# Pneumatics and Solenoids

Pneumatics are pressurized air cylinders that are controlled by solenoids to either extend or retract. They are powered by compressors and can be used all over a robot to perform a variety of tasks. The difference between the two is that a double solenoid can be left in an extended position

## Programming

To program a pneumatic cylinder, you control the solenoid which controls the pneumatic device. There are two types of solenoids, double or single.

## Wiring

To wire your pneumatics, you will first need to have a basic electronics setup. You can reference [this article](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-1/how-to-wire-a-robot.html).
