# Contributing To TorqueLearn

Have knowledge to share? We'd love to have it!

## Editing without cloning

You don't have to clone the entire repository to contribute an article! If you go to [TorqueLearn's Github page](https://github.com/TexasTorque/TorqueLearn) and press `.`, you wil be dropped into a VS Code instance in your browser!

Here you can edit the code like you would on your own machine, including making folders and new files.

## Pushing changes

To push changes, you need to create a pull request on Github. Normally this is a bit of a complicated process, but Github's editor makes it really easy!

First hit the "Source Control" button on the left. You will want to create a new branch using a fork. Then you can [create a commit like usual](Tutorials/Git%20Use/How%20to%20Use%20VSCode%20Git). Next, click on the pull request button. You will be able to add the commit to the pull request against the master the branch. 

This pull request will let us review your changes before implementing. 

Feel free to ask if you have any questions!
